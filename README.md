I am Khushi Samudre, currently a 3rd-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Business Systems (CSBS) at St. Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering and Technology (SVPCET). My passion for technology, problem-solving, and business processes drives me to explore innovative solutions at the intersection of computer science and management.

                        I have hands-on experience in developing projects across various technologies like website development on Personal Budget Planner, Telegram Mini-Apps and Personalized News Aggregator, and I'm continuously expanding my knowledge in areas such as SQL, databases, and real-time systems.
                        
                        In addition to my technical skills, I enjoy participating in hackathons and collaborating on creative projects. Moreover, I have learnt Basics of French speaking language. My goal is to leverage technology to create impactful solutions, especially in areas like automation, security, and user experience.</p></td>
